Summary:
--------
This game hardly even needs an explanation. Players choose a color and move along a multi-colored path towards the game-winning objective.
Movement is very simple. Draw a card and move to the next colored space that matches it. Some cards have 2 colored squares, which means you get to move twice. 
Some spaces have a licorice symbol and cause you to lose a turn, and to really mix things up, there is a special card for each of the special locations that causes you to teleport to that location.

This file summarizes what you will find in each of the files that make up the Dandy Land application.
	index.html        - This is the main application source file.
	


Prerequisites:
-------------- 	    -
1  download .Net Framework 4.0 and install it;              - compatible with source tree
2. Java SE Development Kit 8 Update 55



Setup:
------
1. Notepad++
2. Source Tree                                             -is a free Mercurial and Git Client for Windows and Mac that provides a graphical interface for your Hg and Git repositories
3. .NET Framework 4.5
4. PhoneGap account


After compiling your source code in notepad++, one will need to commit their code using source tree


Building
--------

The build requires Phonegap and the apk installer application to be installed in your development environment. 

PhoneGap is an open source implementation of open standards. That means developers and companies can use PhoneGap for mobile applications that are free, commercial, open source, or any combination of these



Steps to Create a Hello World Application in phonegap and apk installer
-------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: First,Open the Notepad++ write the following code with in the html tags of notepad.

<html>
	<head>
		<script>
			/*GLOBAL VARIABLES*/
			var board=[];//array representing squares of gameboard
			var boardLength=30;//64;//int describing # squares on gameboard. Could be adjustable depending on alternate game rules.
			var boardNoAdjacentColoredSquareBool=true;
			
			var deck=[];//array representing cards in deck
			var deckLength=512;//int describing # cards in deck. Could be adjustable depending on alternate game rules.
			
			var players=[];//array representing players' positions
			var playersLength=4;//int describing # players in game.
			
			var playerNumberTurn=0;//int describing which players turn. Should be incremented after each player's turn and reset to 0 when greater than playersLength var.
			var currentCardIndex=0;//int describing the current card (index). Should be incremented after each turn (and reset to 0 when greater than deckLength var).
			
			var mustLandExactlyOnEndSquare=false;
			
			/*FUNCTIONS*/
			function initGame(){
				//INITIALIZE BOARD
				for(var i=0; i<boardLength;i++){//for-loop to set gameboard's squares. Arrays in JavaScript (and most programming languages) start at 0. This will fill the arrays with elements numbered 0 through 63 (boardLength-1).
					board[i]=
						Math.floor(//round the number to the next lowest integer. See http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_floor.asp
							Math.random()//generate a random number from 0 up to but not including 1. See http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp
							*
							6//multiply it by to get a random number from 0 up to but not including 6.
						);
				}
				
				//INITIALIZE DECK
				for(var i=0; i<deckLength;i++){//for-loop to set deck's card colors.
					deck[i]=

							Math.random()//generate a random number from 0 up to but not including 1. See http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp
							*
							6//multiply it by to get a random number from 0 up to but not including 6.
						);
				}
				
				//INITIALIZE PLAYER POSITIONS (AT 0)
				for(var i=0; i<playersLength;i++){
					players[i]=0;
				}
				
				drawGame();
			}
			function drawGame(){
				var gameString="";
				for(var i=0; i<board.length;i++){//for-loop to loop though gameboard's squares and draw them (and players) on board.
				
					if(i==0) gameString+="START -";//Mark first square with "START"
					else if(i==board.length-1) gameString+="END -";//Mark last (winning) square with "END"
					
					//DRAW GAMEBOARD SQUARES (COLORS)
					//gameString+="\t"+board[i];//draw square #
					gameString+="\t"+colorIndexToName(board[i]);//draw square color
					
					
					//DRAW PLAYER POSITIONS
					for(var j=0; j<players.length;j++){
						if(players[j]==i){//if player's position is same as current square of board. Draw player.
							//for(var k=0; k<j;k++)
								gameString+="\t";//indent to allow multiple players on a line
							gameString+="P"+(j+1);//use +1 to represent 1-4, not 0-3
						}
					}
					gameString+="\n";
				}
				
				document.getElementById("gameTextArea").value=gameString;
				//alert("Ready!")
			}
			function selectCard(){

				}
				
				if(++currentCardIndex>deckLength){//reset currentCardIndex back to 0 if there are no more cards.
					currentCardIndex=0;
					//you could reshuffle deck here too, but you'd have to take out any special cards.
				}
				if(++playerNumberTurn>(playersLength-1))playerNumberTurn=0;
				
				drawGame();
				
				document.getElementById("spanPlayerNumTurn").innerHTML=(playerNumberTurn+1);

</html>


Step 2: Next save the file as index.html

step 3: Open the Following link : Build the PhoneGap application (https://build.phonegap.com/) 

Step 4: Create a account by using Either AdobeID or GitHub)

Step 5: Enter the Login information.

Step 6: Click on add new apps

Step 7: Upload the index.html zip file  and click on create button

Step 8: Next,Successfully the apps are created for android

Step 9: Now the download the file and install in your device using the apk installer app and Test the application
